## How to 4myhr EID Login

Companies often have their internal portals and systems to manage employee information and access various resources. Marriott International is one such company that has its own employee portal called 4myhr. The 4myhr portal serves as a centralized platform for Marriott employees to access tools, resources, and important information related to their employment. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform the 4myhr EID Login successfully.

### What is the 4myhr EID?

Before diving into the login process, it's essential to understand what the 4myhr EID exactly is. EID stands for Enterprise Identity Management, and it serves as a unique identifier for each Marriott employee. The EID is issued to employees upon joining Marriott and allows them to access various internal systems such as 4myhr.

### Step-by-Step Guide to 4myhr EID Login:

Follow the steps below to log in to your Marriott 4myhr EID account:

1. **Launch your preferred web browser:** Open your web browser, whether it's Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or any other browser of your choice.

2. **Access the 4myhr Portal:** In the address bar of your web browser, enter the URL for the 4myhr portal. Typically, the URL is something like "https://www.4myhr.com" or "https://marriott-4myhr.sso.login". Press Enter to navigate to the login page.

3. **Enter EID and Password:** On the 4myhr login page, you will find the fields to enter your EID and password. Enter your unique EID in the designated field.

4. **Provide your Password:** After entering your EID, move to the password field. Input your correct password associated with the given EID. It's crucial to be mindful of uppercase and lowercase letters and ensure the password is entered correctly.

5. **Click on "Sign In":** Once you have entered both your EID and password, click on the "Sign In" button to proceed.

6. **Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled):** In some cases, Marriott may have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) as an additional layer of security. If prompted, follow the instructions to complete the 2FA process. This might involve providing a verification code received on your registered email or phone.

7. **Access your 4myhr Account:** After successfully completing the login and any required two-factor authentication, you will be redirected to your 4myhr account homepage. From there, you can explore and utilize various tools, access information, and perform tasks relevant to your employment at Marriott.

### Frequently Asked Questions:

Q2. **Is the 4myhr EID the same as my Marriott employee ID?**

A2. No, the 4myhr EID is not the same as your Marriott employee ID. While the 4myhr EID serves as the identifier required to log in to the 4myhr portal, your Marriott employee ID is a separate identification number specific to your employment within the company.

A3. If you are experiencing difficulties while attempting to log in to your 4myhr account, it is advisable to clear your browser cache and cookies and try again.
