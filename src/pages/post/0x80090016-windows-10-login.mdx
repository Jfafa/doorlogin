### Introduction
The 0x80090016 error code is a common issue that Windows 10 users encounter when trying to log into their system. This error can be frustrating as it prevents you from accessing your computer and often leaves you feeling helpless. However, fear not! In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to resolve the 0x80090016 Windows 10 login error. By following these steps, you can regain access to your computer and eliminate this annoying glitch.

### Understanding the 0x80090016 Error
Before diving into the troubleshooting steps, let's first understand what the 0x80090016 error actually means. This error code is typically associated with a problem in the user profile service, which is responsible for loading and managing user profiles during the login process. When this service encounters an issue, it triggers the 0x80090016 error, preventing you from logging in to Windows 10.

### Step 1: Restart Your Computer
Often, a simple restart can fix temporary glitches or conflicts that may be causing the 0x80090016 error. Follow these steps to restart your computer properly:

1. Click on the "Start" button.
2. Select the "Power" option.
3. Choose "Restart" from the drop-down menu.

After your computer restarts, attempt to log in again and check if the error persists. If the error continues to appear, proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Use Safe Mode to Troubleshoot
Using Safe Mode can help you identify if any third-party applications or services are causing the login error. Follow these steps to boot your computer into Safe Mode:

1. Press the "Windows" key and the "I" key simultaneously to open the "Settings" menu.
2. Click on the "Update & Security" option.
3. In the left menu, select "Recovery."
4. Under the "Advanced startup" section, click on the "Restart now" button.
5. Your computer will restart and display several startup options.
6. Choose "Troubleshoot" > "Advanced options" > "Startup Settings."
7. Click on the "Restart" button.
8. When your computer restarts again, press the "F5" key to select Safe Mode with Networking.

Once in Safe Mode, attempt to log in and check if the error still shows up. If the error does not appear in Safe Mode, it indicates that a third-party app or service is causing the issue. You can then proceed to disable or uninstall recently installed applications or use a clean boot to pinpoint the problematic software.

### Step 3: Run System File Checker (SFC) Scan
System File Checker is a built-in Windows tool that scans and repairs corrupt or missing system files. Running an SFC scan can help resolve any underlying file-related issues that may be causing the 0x80090016 error. Follow these steps to run an SFC scan:

1. Press the "Windows" key and type "Command Prompt."
2. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator."
3. In the command prompt window, type the following command and press Enter: `sfc /scannow`

Allow the scan to complete, as it may take some time. If any issues are found, the SFC scan will attempt to repair them automatically. After the scan finishes, restart your computer and try logging in to check if the error persists.
