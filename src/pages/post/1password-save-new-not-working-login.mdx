# How to Fix 1Password Not Saving New Logins

## Introduction
1Password is a popular password manager that enables users to securely store and manage their passwords. However, some users may encounter issues where 1Password fails to save new logins. This can become a frustrating experience, especially when you rely on the application to streamline your online activities. In this article, we will delve into the possible causes of this problem and provide detailed solutions to fix the issue.

## Possible Causes for 1Password Not Saving New Logins
### 1. Extension Compatibility Issues
If you have the browser extension of 1Password installed, compatibility issues may arise and prevent the application from saving new logins. Incompatibility with certain browser versions or conflicting extensions can disrupt the functioning of 1Password.

### 2. Incorrect Password or Account Settings
Sometimes, users may not realize that the issue lies with incorrect settings or passwords in their 1Password account. If the account settings are misconfigured or the master password is entered incorrectly, it can hinder 1Password's ability to save new logins.

### 3. Software or Browser Updates
Like any other software or browser extension, 1Password requires timely updates to ensure its compatibility with the latest technology. Failing to update both the 1Password application and your browser can lead to issues, including the inability to save new logins.

### 4. Damaged 1Password Database
Occasionally, corrupt or damaged database files can affect the functionality of 1Password. If the database is compromised, it may not function properly and thus prevent the successful saving of new logins.

## Solutions for Fixing 1Password Not Saving New Logins
### Solution 1: Verify Extension Compatibility
First, ensure that the browser extension you are using is compatible with both your browser version and the 1Password application. You can check for compatibility updates on the official website or reach out to 1Password support for assistance. Disabling conflicting extensions temporarily can also help identify the cause if compatibility issues persist.

### Solution 2: Review Password and Account Settings
Double-check your account settings in 1Password, making sure that everything is configured correctly. Verify that your master password is entered accurately and try resetting it if necessary. Additionally, ensure that the login details you are attempting to save are valid and properly formatted.

### Solution 3: Update 1Password and Your Browser
To eliminate potential compatibility bugs, make sure both your 1Password application and browser are updated to the latest versions. Developers frequently release updates to address known issues and maintain compatibility with evolving technologies. Updating to the latest versions can potentially resolve the issue of 1Password not saving new logins.

### Solution 4: Repair or Rebuild 1Password Database
If none of the above solutions prove effective, you may need to repair or rebuild the 1Password database. This process can fix any potential corruption or damage, enabling 1Password to save new logins properly. Detailed instructions on repairing or rebuilding the database can be found in the official 1Password documentation.
