## How to Solve the "530 Authentication Failed" Error in Core FTP Login

### Introduction
The "530 Authentication Failed" error is a common issue that users encounter when trying to log in to Core FTP. This error message indicates a problem with the authentication process, preventing successful login. In this article, we will explore the possible causes of this error and provide detailed steps to troubleshoot and resolve it.

### Understanding the "530 Authentication Failed" Error
The "530 Authentication Failed" error typically occurs when there is an issue with the login credentials or the connection settings for Core FTP. It implies that the server did not validate the information provided during login, resulting in failed authentication. To resolve this error, we need to delve into the potential causes and follow specific troubleshooting steps.

### Possible Causes of the "530 Authentication Failed" Error
1. Incorrect Username or Password: The most common cause of this error is incorrect login credentials. Double-check the username and password you are entering to ensure they are accurate. Pay attention to letter case sensitivity as well.

2. Connection Settings: The connection settings in Core FTP must be configured correctly to establish a successful connection with the server. Incorrectly configured settings, such as the server address, port number, or encryption options, can result in authentication failures.

3. Firewall or Antivirus Interference: Sometimes, firewalls or antivirus software settings can interfere with the FTP connection and cause authentication issues. These security measures might block certain ports or protocols used by Core FTP, hindering the authentication process.

### Troubleshooting Steps to Resolve the "530 Authentication Failed" Error
1. Verify Login Credentials: Double-check the username and password you are utilizing. Make sure they are correct and ensure you are not accidentally using credentials from a different service or platform.

2. Review Connection Settings: Check the connection settings within Core FTP. Ensure that the server address, port number, and encryption options are accurate and in line with the server's requirements. If uncertain, consult with your hosting provider for the correct settings.

3. Temporarily Disable Firewalls and Antivirus: Temporarily disabling your firewall or antivirus software can help determine if they are causing any interference with the FTP connection. If the error no longer occurs after disabling them, adjust the settings to allow Core FTP to communicate freely.

4. Use Passive FTP Mode: Core FTP offers both active and passive FTP modes. If you encounter authentication issues, try switching to passive FTP mode. Go to "Site Manager" within Core FTP, select your server profile, and under the "Advanced" tab, enable "Passive Mode (for Firewall)." Save the changes and attempt to log in again.

5. Contact Hosting Provider: If none of the above steps resolve the error, it is advisable to contact your hosting provider for assistance. They may be able to investigate server-side issues or provide guidance on specific configurations required for successful authentication.
