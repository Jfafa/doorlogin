### Step 1: Accessing the Login Page
To begin the login process, you need to visit the official 1stopmove website. Open your preferred web browser and enter the URL - www.1stopmove.com - into the address bar. Press Enter to load the website. Once the homepage loads, locate and click on the "Login" button in the top right corner of the page. This will redirect you to the login page.

### Step 2: Entering Your Credentials
On the 1stopmove login page, you will find fields requiring your username and password. Fill in these fields with the correct information associated with your account. Take care to enter your credentials accurately, as an incorrect username or password will result in login errors.

### Step 3: Completing the CAPTCHA
To ensure secure login, 1stopmove utilizes a CAPTCHA verification system. This system distinguishes between human users and automated bots attempting unauthorized access. On the login page, you will notice a CAPTCHA box displaying a combination of letters, numbers, or images. You need to carefully enter the characters you see in the appropriate field. If the characters are unclear, you can request a new CAPTCHA by clicking the refresh icon or the corresponding link.

### Step 4: Initiating Login
Once you have entered your credentials and completed the CAPTCHA, double-check your information to avoid any mistakes. After you are confident that everything is correct, click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button to initiate the login process. The system will verify your credentials and redirect you to your personalized account dashboard upon successful authentication.
