## How to Fix the "530 Login Incorrect FTP" Error

### Introduction
If you have encountered the "530 Login Incorrect FTP" error message while trying to connect to a specific FTP server, don't worry. This error typically occurs when the login credentials provided are incorrect or there are configuration issues on either the client or server side. In this article, we will guide you through the troubleshooting steps to resolve the 530 error and regain access to your FTP server.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Double-check your FTP credentials:
   - Ensure that you have typed the correct username and password. Be cautious of any typos or capitalization errors, as FTP login credentials are case-sensitive.
   - If you are unsure about the correct credentials, reach out to your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.
  
2. Verify the FTP server details:
   - Check that you have entered the correct FTP server address or hostname. Verify that the hostname is spelled correctly and doesn't contain any unnecessary prefixes (e.g., "ftp.").
   - Verify that the FTP port number used is the correct one. The default FTP port is 21, but it can be different depending on the server configuration.
  
3. Verify your FTP client configuration:
   - Ensure that your FTP client settings are correctly configured to connect to the server using the appropriate protocol (e.g., FTP, FTPS, SFTP).
   - If you are using a specific FTP mode (active or passive), ensure it is compatible with the server's settings. Try switching between active and passive modes to see if it resolves the issue.

4. Check for server-side configuration issues:
   - Sometimes, the "530 Login Incorrect FTP" error can occur due to server-side configuration problems. Contact your hosting provider or system administrator to verify if there are any configuration issues or temporary server problems.
   - It is possible that the server is rejecting connections from specific IP addresses. Ensure that your IP address is not blocked or blacklisted on the server. If it is, request your hosting provider to whitelist it.
   - In some cases, the server may enforce secure FTP connections (FTPS or SFTP) and reject regular FTP connections. Make sure your FTP client settings correspond to the server's requirements.

5. Test with alternate FTP client:
   - Try connecting to the FTP server using a different FTP client or application to rule out any potential issues with your current FTP client's configuration.
   - There are various FTP clients available, both free and paid, that you can download and test. Some popular ones include FileZilla, Cyberduck, WinSCP, and CuteFTP.
