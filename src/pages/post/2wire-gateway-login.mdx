1. **Connect to the Gateway**: Firstly, connect your device (e.g., computer or smartphone) to the 2Wire gateway using an Ethernet cable or by joining the wireless network named after your 2Wire gateway.

2. **Access the Login Page**: Once connected, open a web browser of your preference and type the default gateway IP address into the address bar. Typically, this IP address is http://192.168.1.254. Press Enter to access the 2Wire gateway login page.

3. **Enter Login Credentials**: On the login page, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. These credentials are specific to your 2Wire gateway.
