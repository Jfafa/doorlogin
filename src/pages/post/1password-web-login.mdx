With 1Password, you only need to remember a single master password or use biometric authentication to access all your stored data.

## Set Up 1Password Account

To use 1Password web login, you need to have an active 1Password account. Follow these simple steps to set up your account:

2. Once on the website, look for the "Sign Up" or "Get Started" button and click on it.
3. Provide the required information, including your email address and create a secure master password. Remember, your master password is the key to accessing all your stored passwords, so it should be strong and unique.
4. Complete the registration process by verifying your email address, if necessary.

Once your 1Password account is set up, you are ready to proceed with the web login process.

## Accessing 1Password on the Web
