## How to Use 3CX to Queue Login

### Introduction
3CX is a powerful and feature-rich VoIP phone system that allows businesses of all sizes to streamline their communication processes. One important aspect of a business's phone system is the ability to efficiently manage and prioritize incoming calls. This is where the concept of a queue comes into play. In this article, we will delve into the details of how to use 3CX to queue login, ensuring that you can effectively handle and distribute incoming calls within your organization.

### Why Queue Login is Important
Before we delve into the specifics, let's briefly discuss the importance of queue login within a business phone system. Queue login allows employees to join predefined call queues, where they can handle incoming calls based on their availability and expertise. By having employees log in to specific queues, a business can ensure that calls are distributed fairly among team members, resulting in improved customer service and reduced wait times.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using 3CX to Queue Login

#### Step 1: Accessing your 3CX Management Console
To begin using 3CX to queue login, you need to access the 3CX Management Console. Open your preferred web browser and enter the IP address or domain name of your 3CX server, followed by `/management`. For example, if your 3CX server's IP address is 192.168.1.100, enter `http://192.168.1.100/management` in the address bar.

#### Step 2: Logging In to the Management Console
Once you have accessed the 3CX Management Console, enter your credentials to log in. These credentials are typically provided by your system administrator. Upon successful login, you will be taken to the dashboard of the Management Console.

#### Step 3: Navigating to Queue Settings
In the Management Console, navigate to the "Settings" menu, usually located on the left-hand side. Click on "Queue Settings" to access the configuration options related to queues.

#### Step 4: Creating a Queue
To create a new queue, click on the "Add" button or an equivalent option, depending on the version of 3CX you are using. Provide a name for the queue and configure other parameters, such as the maximum number of callers allowed in the queue at a time and the maximum wait time before calls are redirected.

#### Step 5: Configuring Queue Login
Within the queue settings, you will find options related to queue login. Enable the queue login feature and specify the authentication method. You can choose between PIN authentication or authentication based on a user's extension. Enable any additional login settings or validations, such as requiring a login PIN for agents to join the queue.

#### Step 6: Assigning Users to the Queue
To allow users to log in to a specific queue, navigate to the "Users" tab within the queue settings. In the list of available users, select the desired ones and click on the "Assign Selected" button. The selected users will now have access to login to the queue and handle incoming calls.
