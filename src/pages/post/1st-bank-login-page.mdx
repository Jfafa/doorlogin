### Troubleshooting: Common Login Issues

#### 1. I Forgot My Username/Password. How Can I Recover Them?

If you forget your username or password, don't worry. Most banks, including 1st Bank, offer easy methods to recover your login credentials. Here's what you can do:

- Recovering Username: On the login page, look for an option such as "Forgot Username" or "Username Recovery." Click on it, and you will be directed to a page where you can enter the required details to recover your username. This may include providing your email address, phone number, or account information. Follow the instructions provided, and you should receive an email or SMS with your username shortly.

- Resetting Password: If you have forgotten your password, look for an option like "Forgot Password" or "Password Reset" on the login page. Click on it, and you will be prompted to enter your username (if known) and possibly answer security questions or provide other account-specific details. Follow the steps provided, and you will be able to create a new password for your account.

#### 2. I am Unable to Login. What Could Be the Issue?

Encountering difficulties while logging in can be frustrating, but there are a few common causes and solutions you can try:

- Double-Check Your Credentials: Confirm that you are entering the correct username and password. Remember, they are case-sensitive. Be cautious of any typos or incorrect capitalization that may prevent successful login.

- Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: Over time, your browser's cache and cookies can accumulate data that may interfere with the login process. Clearing them can help resolve any technical issues. To do this, navigate to your browser's settings, find the clear cache and cookies option, and proceed accordingly.

Financial institutions like 1st Bank prioritize the security and privacy of their customers' information. The login page is equipped with robust security measures to ensure the protection of your data. However, it is essential for you to practice good online security habits to further enhance your safety:

- Create a Strong Password: Choose a password that is unique and difficult to guess. It's best to include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- Enable Two-Factor Authentication: Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. This typically involves receiving a code or notification on your mobile device that you need to enter or approve to complete the login process.
