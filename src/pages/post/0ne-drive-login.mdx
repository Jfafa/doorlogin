By following the instructions provided below, you will be able to login to your OneDrive account and take full advantage of its features.

## Step 1: Accessing the OneDrive Login Page

To begin the login process, open your preferred web browser and navigate to the official OneDrive login page. You can do this by typing "onedrive.com" in the address bar and pressing Enter. Once the page loads, you should see the login form.

## Step 2: Entering Your Credentials

In the provided login form, you will be prompted to enter your Microsoft account email address or phone number. Ensure that you provide the correct information associated with your OneDrive account. After entering the email address, click the "Next" button.

Make sure you type it accurately, paying attention to letter case and any special characters. Finally, click the "Sign in" button to proceed.

## Step 4: Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)
