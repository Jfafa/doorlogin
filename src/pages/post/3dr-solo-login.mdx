### Steps to Log in to 3DR Solo

2. Connect to the Drone's Wi-Fi
   - On your smartphone or tablet, go to the Wi-Fi settings and search for available networks.
   - Locate the Wi-Fi network name associated with your 3DR Solo drone. It typically starts with "SoloLink" followed by a series of numbers and letters.
   - Tap on the drone's Wi-Fi network to connect to it.
   - If prompted, enter the password for the Solo's Wi-Fi network. The default password is usually provided with the drone's documentation or can be found on the back of the Solo Controller.
3. Launch the App
   - Once you are connected to the drone's Wi-Fi network, launch the 3DR Solo app on your smartphone or tablet.
   - Wait for the app to detect the drone's presence. This may take a few seconds, depending on the signal strength and network connectivity.
4. Log in to the App
   - On the app's login screen, enter your username and password. If you are using the app for the first time, you may need to create a new account.
   - Double-check the accuracy of your login credentials to ensure a successful login.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. What should I do if I forget my 3DR Solo login credentials?

If you have forgotten your 3DR Solo login credentials, you can try the following options:
- Tap on the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen of the app. This will guide you through the password recovery process, usually involving email verification or security questions.
- If you are unable to recover your password through the above method, contact 3DR customer support for further assistance. They can help you regain access to your account and provide guidance on password reset procedures or account recovery.

#### 2. Can I log in to my 3DR Solo drone using multiple devices simultaneously?

No, the 3DR Solo drone is designed to connect and communicate with a single device at a time. Once your primary device is connected to the Solo's Wi-Fi network and logged into the app, any other device attempting to connect will be disconnected automatically. This ensures a secure and uninterrupted connection between the drone and the controlling device.

Yes, it is highly recommended to change your default login credentials to enhance security and protect your 3DR Solo drone. Within the solo app, navigate to the account settings or options menu, where you can find the option to change your username and password. Choose a strong and unique password that is not easily guessable to maintain the privacy and integrity of your drone.
