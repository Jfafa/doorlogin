# How to 365 Microsoft Login

Microsoft 365, previously known as Office 365, is a popular cloud-based productivity suite offered by Microsoft. It includes various applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more, along with cloud services like OneDrive and Teams. To make the most of Microsoft 365, users need to log in to their accounts. In this article, we will guide you through the process of logging in to your Microsoft 365 account step by step.

## Step 1: Open a Web Browser

To begin the Microsoft 365 login process, open your preferred web browser on your computer or mobile device. Microsoft 365 is compatible with popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

## Step 2: Visit the Microsoft 365 Login Page

In the address bar of your web browser, type in the official Microsoft 365 login page URL. You can find this by searching on search engines like Google, or by directly entering "365 Microsoft login" in the search bar.

## Step 3: Enter Your Email Address

Once you have reached the Microsoft 365 login page, you will see a space provided to enter your email address. Type in the email address associated with your Microsoft 365 account in this field. Make sure to double-check for any spelling errors to ensure a smooth login process.

## Step 4: Click on the Next Button

After entering your email address correctly, click on the "Next" button. This will proceed to the next step of the login process.

## Step 5: Enter Your Password

On the following page, you will be prompted to enter your password. Microsoft 365 requires a strong and unique password for account security. Carefully type your password in the provided field.

## Step 6: Enable or Disable "Stay Signed In"

Below the password field, you will notice a checkbox that says "Stay Signed In."

Decide whether you want to enable or disable this option based on your preferences.
