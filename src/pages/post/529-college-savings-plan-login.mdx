### Tips for Secure 529 College Savings Plan Login

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your login process. Enable this feature if your 529 college savings plan provider offers it. It often involves receiving a verification code via SMS or email that you need to enter along with your password.

If you forget your username or password, don't panic. Generally, there is a "Forgot Username" or "Forgot Password" option on the login page. Click on the appropriate link and follow the instructions provided by your 529 college savings plan provider to recover your account credentials.

**Q3: Can I access my 529 college savings plan account offline?**
