### Understanding 401k Accounts

Before we dive into the login process, let's take a moment to understand what a 401k account entails. A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to set aside a portion of their pre-tax income for retirement.

3. On the login page, enter your username and password in the respective fields. It's worth noting that Schwab provides secure access to your account, so ensure that you're using a strong password for added security.
4. Once you have entered your login credentials, click on the "Log In" button.
5. Schwab may use additional security measures to verify your identity, such as two-factor authentication. Follow the prompts to complete the verification process.
6. After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to your 401k account dashboard, where you can access various features and manage your retirement savings.
