### Step 1: Accessing the 3M My Workday Login Page

To begin the login process, you need to open a web browser on your device and navigate to the official 3M My Workday login page. This page is designed specifically for 3M employees to access their Workday account easily. You can directly type the URL "https://www.myworkday.com/3m/login.htmld" in the address bar and hit enter.

### Step 2: Providing Your Credentials

Once you have reached the 3M My Workday login page, you will be required to enter your login credentials to proceed further. The login page will typically have two input fields for entering your username and password. Make sure you input the correct information in each respective field to avoid any login errors.

### Step 3: Authentication and Security Verification

After entering your login credentials, you may need to go through an additional security verification process. This step is to ensure that you are the authorized user of the account and to maintain the utmost security. Workday may use various methods, such as two-factor authentication or security questions, to verify your identity. Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the verification process.

### Step 4: Navigate Dashboard and Features

This dashboard serves as a control center, offering access to various features and information related to your employment at 3M. You can explore different sections like personal profile, benefits, time tracking, pay slips, and more, depending on your role and access level.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting Login Issues

In case you encounter any login issues or have forgotten your password, 3M provides a simple password recovery process. On the login page, you can click on the "Forgot Password?" link. You will then be prompted to provide your registered email address, and instructions to reset your password will be sent to that email.
