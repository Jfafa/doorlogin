It is essential to use descriptive and keyword-rich H2 tags for better search engine optimization (SEO).

2. Write High-Quality and Unique Content: Aim to provide valuable and informative content that stands out from the crowd. Unique and well-written articles have higher chances of ranking well on search engine result pages.
3. Incorporate Lists: Lists help break down complex information into smaller, digestible chunks. They make it easier for readers to skim through the content and locate specific details. Additionally, lists also enhance the visual appeal of your article.
