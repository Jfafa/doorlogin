### Setting Up Your 2 Wire Device
Before we proceed with the login process, it is essential to set up your 2 Wire device properly. Follow these steps to ensure a successful login:

1. **Unbox and Assemble:** Start by unboxing your 2 Wire network device and gather all the necessary components. Carefully assemble the device, making sure to connect all cables securely.

2. **Connect to Power Source:** Plug in the power adapter provided with your 2 Wire device into a nearby power outlet. Ensure a stable power supply to avoid any interruptions during the login process.

3. **Establish Connection:** Connect one end of an Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port on your 2 Wire device and the other end to your computer or laptop. Make sure the connection is secure to prevent any network disruptions.

4. **Power On:** Turn on your 2 Wire device by pressing the power button or flipping the switch. Wait for a few moments for the device to initialize and establish a connection with your computer.

### Accessing the 2 Wire Login Portal
Once your 2 Wire device is powered on and connected, you can proceed to access the login portal. The following steps will guide you through the process:

1. **Open a Web Browser:** Launch any web browser installed on your computer, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Ensure you are using an up-to-date version for optimum compatibility.

2. **Enter Default Gateway Address:** In the browser's address bar, type in the default gateway address of your 2 Wire device. The default gateway is usually "192.168.1.1" or "192.168.0.1". Press Enter to proceed.

3. **Username and Password:** On the login page, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. By default, for most 2 Wire devices, the username is "admin," and the password is typically "password." Enter the credentials and click on the Login or Sign In button.

4. **Access Granted:** If the entered credentials are correct, you will be granted access to the 2 Wire device's control panel or management interface. You can now customize various settings, including network configurations, security options, and more, depending on your device model and firmware version.
